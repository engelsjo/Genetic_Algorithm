With our final project in CIS 678 - Machine Learning, we implement a genetic algorithm (GA) to find the global min of two complex functions: Rosenbrock's Banana function and Goldstein-Price function. Using concepts similar to natural biology, we construct an algorithm that pinpoints with high accuracy the minimum values of various functions. Modeling the inputs to the functions as chromosomes, we select the most fit chromosomes. Using the most fit chromosomes, we breed a new population of children organisms using crossover. We then recursively repeat this strategy of choosing the most fit organisms, and breeding until our population converges to the most fit.
